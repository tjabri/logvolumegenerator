# This is an example configuration file with the required and optional settings.
# You don't need to provide a configuration file, but it is available for your convenience.
# All of these parameters can be passed in as environment variables, as described below.
# If using this file, name it `configuration.toml` and place it in the current directory where the app is running.

# Required setting
# Environment variable equivalent: LOG_output_size
# String representation of a storage size, example: "500MB"
output_size = "500MB"

# Required setting
# Environment variable equivalent: LOG_duration
# String representation of a duration, example: "10s"
duration = "10s"

# Optional setting
# Environment variable equivalent: LOG_max_lines_output
# Default max_lines_output: 0
# Change this setting if you want to output only N number of log lines at maximum
# This does not change the output rate, so it's handy for testing purposes
# This setting overrides the output duration setting, if writing N lines happens before the specified duration
max_lines_output = 0 # default: 0 (you can omit this setting if the default is desired)

# Optional setting
# Environment variable equivalent: LOG_output_format
# Default output_format: "plaintext"
# Valid options: "plaintext", "json"
# You do not need to specify this setting if the default is desired
output_format = "plaintext" # default: "plaintext"
